# My Personal Angular 10 Website, with Neumorphism UI/UX Design

This project was made using Angular 10.

Website: `http://eduardocorreia.20cafes.com`

Note: `20cafes.com` is a domain owned by myself (Eduardo Correia), which is used to host my other personal big project, the 20Caf√©s community website.
